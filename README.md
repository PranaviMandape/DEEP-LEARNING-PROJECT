# Project Description

This project focuses on designing and implementing a deep learning model for image classification using TensorFlow. The primary goal is to develop a robust and accurate model capable of classifying images into predefined categories. Image classification is one of the most fundamental and impactful applications of deep learning in fields such as healthcare, autonomous driving and security systems.The deliverable includes a fully functional deep learning model along with visualizations of its performance metrics and prediction results, providing a comprehensive end-to-end pipeline from data preparation to evaluation.

# Objective

The main objective of this project is to build a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based deep learning model that can learn and generalize from image data. The model should accurately classify unseen images and provide insights into its predictions through performance visualization tools.

# Tools & Technologies

Jupyter Notebook

Python

TensorFlow & Keras

Matplotlib & Seaborn

NumPy & Pandas

# Key Features

Data Preprocessing: Includes image resizing, normalization and data augmentation to enhance model generalization and reduce overfitting.

Model Architecture: Utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN), a popular choice for image data, designed with multiple convolutional and pooling layers followed by fully connected dense layers.

Training & Validation: The model is trained using a split of training and validation data, allowing continuous monitoring of performance.

Evaluation Metrics: Includes accuracy, loss, confusion matrix and classification report to assess model performance comprehensively.

Visualization: Plots of training and validation accuracy/loss curves, sample predictions with true vs. predicted labels and confusion matrix to provide intuitive understanding of model behavior.

Flexibility: The architecture and hyperparameters can be easily modified to experiment with different configurations and datasets.


# Outcomes

The final deep learning model achieved high accuracy on the validation set, demonstrating its ability to correctly classify images. The use of visualizations throughout the training and evaluation process helped identify potential areas for improvement and confirmed the modelâ€™s reliability. This project serves as a strong foundation for future enhancements, such as using transfer learning with pretrained models like VGG16 or ResNet to further boost accuracy.
